ANALYSIS RULES:
1. Calculate ALL possible metrics from the transaction and debt data
2. Generate insights based on patterns, anomalies, and financial best practices
3. Provide specific recommendations with actionable steps
4. Assess risks based on utilization, payment history, and debt levels
5. Identify trends in spending, payments, and credit usage
6. Use realistic financial thresholds (e.g., utilization >30% is high, payment delay >30 days is concerning)
7. All scores should be 0-100 scale
8. All monetary values should be precise to 2 decimal places
9. Include specific data points that support each insight
10. Prioritize insights by severity and impact
